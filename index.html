        <p class="post">I travelled to <em>Churriana</em> and enjoyed the beautiful views of the airport. The melodic sound of the planes' engines enlightened my walk. I had a very pleasant car accident with a resident of Churriana, that end up at police office.</p>

        <p class="post">I travelled to the nearest embassy of China. There, I claimed my second nationality. I can legally claim it because my great grandfather went to China during the second <em>Sino-japanese war</em> as part of a aid group. He was a doctor, and eventually fell in love with my great grandmother, the legitimate heir to the throne of the <strong>Ming Dinasty</strong>. Unfortunately, the embassy workers didn't believed me, so I returned home upset.</p>
